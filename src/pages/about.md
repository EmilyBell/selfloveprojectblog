Hi I’m Emily, the girl behind all this! I’m 22 and I live in Bradford, West Yorkshire.

After recently struggling with my own battles and finding self love extremely hard to understand and practice – I realised how much I genuinely want to help other people who feel as though they’re in the same position. A lot of people are afraid to speak out about mental health for a number of reasons – seeming like a failure, fear of not being taken seriously, and a lot don’t even realise they’re struggling! If I know that I am helping at least one person out there then I’m positive that I’m doing the right thing.
