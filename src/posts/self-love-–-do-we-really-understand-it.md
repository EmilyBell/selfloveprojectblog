Welcome to my blog!

After a lot of time internally debating the pros and cons, I’ve finally decided to bite the bullet and launch a blog to raise awareness of mental health, the importance of understanding and promoting healthy habits and to share my own experience, in the hope it will comfort or inspire others in a similar situation.

Initially, I wanted to dedicate my entire blog to the link between mental health and self love, but I realised how entirely ignorant that would be. Mental health is a serious, deep issue and ‘self love’ definitely isn’t the sole cure, but it is a piece of the wider puzzle to a happier, healthy mind.

Before I go on, I would like to point out that I am absolutely and in no way claiming to be a mental health professional. Everything I write about is based solely on my own experiences, lessons, as well as observing those around me.

For quite a few years now, especially the past two, I’ve felt completely lost, unstable, and ‘different’ to everyone else. I’ve always felt like my brain just somehow doesn’t work in the same way as those around me. I’ve found myself desperate for help, pleading everyone around me to help me get over the way I’m feeling, yet at the same time massively distancing myself in fear of being misunderstood. Pulling yourself out of a dark, low place can be incredibly difficult. It feels as though you’ve got a permanent dark, foggy cloud over your head, and it can be genuinely easy to forget how to think or feel differently.

During my lowest times, I’ve been seeing therapists, googling endless blogs, simply trying to find out what was going on in my head. Every answer I seemed to find was related to ‘self love’ and ‘self care’.

“Just love yourself and everything will fall into place.”

## But what does ‘self love’ even mean and how can I just ‘flick the switch’?

Honestly, I felt like this phrase was being thrown around with no guidance on how to practice it. We have all these guidelines and structures to help us manage exercising, diet, our work life, but there doesn’t seem to be a way to learn or practice ‘self love’. It isn’t like you can buy or acquire ‘self love’ and without clarity on what it is, it all felt completely meaningless to me.

## However, this is where everything changed for me as I was not ready to give up.

Through in depth research, I came to realisation that I was completely misunderstanding what ‘self love’ actually meant. Initially, I genuinely thought the term was to be content with your outward appearance and brushing off any criticism you may receive. Maybe going to the gym a bit more and doing a couple of face masks a few nights a week. Of course, it’s important to be happy with the way you look and have confidence in yourself. 

But ‘self love’ goes way way way way deeper than this. I believe self love is accepting responsibility for your own actions, understanding your own thoughts and where they come from, no matter how dangerous or ‘bad’ they may seem. I’m talking about the power of vulnerability, setting and maintaining boundaries, as well as accepting that you won’t always feel happy and positive.

There is no step-by-step guide with an ultimate result at the end. As cheesy at it may sound, learning to love yourself and accept your whole being, really is a journey and a dedication of thorough, in depth practice. For me personally, it begins with baby steps and getting to down to the roots of your own thoughts – whether that is related to childhood, a toxic relationship, or any other kind of battle.

It is a combination of positive steps, meditation and self-actualisation, which doesn’t happen overnight. But there is always hope.

Although I’m not a professional, I have a desire to share my story and if it touches just one person, I know it’s been good for something.

If you are seeking further support or guidance and believe you could benefit from a professional, contact your local GP, Walk in Centre or reach out to the incredible resources available from charities such as [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) and the [Samaritans](https://www.samaritans.org/).

Please keep a look out for my future blog posts, there is a LOT of content I really want to cover!
